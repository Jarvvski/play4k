# play4k

A space for me to explore ideas around;
- gradle
- JVM (mostly Kotlin these days)

## Experiments

- `state-machine`: Just playing around with the [state4k](https://github.com/fork-handles/forkhandles/tree/trunk/state4k) library
- `aws-fargate`: Setting up blue/green deployments in AWS with a small spring boot service
